# WAVE300
Sources for Lantiq WAVE300 wi-fi drivers

The aim of this project is to upbring the sources to newer Linux kernels.

-LEGAL DISCLAIMER-
The original sources of this git came with no license file although in the code of the modules it is clearly stated "proprietary".

In previous releases of the drivers, there's a general LICENSE (txt) file where dual BSD/GPL is granted.

Being sources found an evolution of the old ones, the LICENSE (txt) file and its content must be kept.

However, being myself an absolute newcomer into open-source world and license, I beg the original authors & owners of this code Infineon/Lantiq/Intel to correct me if I'm wrong and I will immediatly turn down this git.
