*\brief Tasks serializer based on "command" design pattern ideology

*\defgroup SERIALIZER Tasks serializer
*\{

   Tasks serializer provides services for commands offloading to waitable 
   single-threaded context. Commands enqueued are being executed one by one
   with respect to command priority specified by caller. Commands are cancelable,
   each command enqueued may be canceled unless its processing was already started.
   The serializer is thread safe i.e. maintains reentrability internally.

   There are two main usage scenarious for the serializer:
     -# Blocked command invocation
       - Command object is declared on stack
       - Command is being executed by mtlk_serializer_execute_blocked() API
     -# Synchronous command invocation
        - Command object is declared on stack
        - Command is being initialized
        - Command is being enqueued
        - Thread is waiting for some specific event to be signaled by completion callback
     -# Asynchronous command invocation
        - Command object is a member of some modules's structure
        - Command is being initialized in object's modules function
        - Command is being enqueued
        - Completion callback optionally notifies thread that command execution finished

\see serializer_test.c Unit tests for serializer, may be used as usage example reference.
