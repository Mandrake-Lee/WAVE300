*\defgroup FAST_MEM Fast memory allocator
*\{

  Fast memory allocator provides memory allocation services from fast memory pool,
  in case it is supported by platform. If there is no fast memory pool on the
  platform, usual memory provided by mtlk_osal_mem_alloc/mtlk_osal_mem_free is used.
  Since fast memory is extremely expensive resource, there is special algorithm
  intended to fine tune fast memory allocation for different driver modules.
  Module client wanting to allocate fast memory is to identify itself by providing
  its ID. System integrator may specify which clients receive memory from fast pool,
  while others receive usual memory from OSAL allocator.
