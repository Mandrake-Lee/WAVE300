- Packet capture support added to Debug API.
- Multiple cards support added. Use ENABLE_MULTI_CARD to enable

  initial ping from AP was not working (relates to bug#698?)
- Bug#735 fixed - application wasn't able to get long ESSID (32 characters)
  with SIOCGIWESSID ioctl
- SIOCSIWESSID handler is compatible with WE21 from now. See
  http://lwn.net/Articles/202838 for details.
- Counter for number of received replayed packets added.
- From now default channel is zero and ESSID is empty, so automatic card
  activation on ifconfig will be possible if these both are configured
  explicitly by user.
- Feature#740 - filter only 802.1X packets before keys are set in secure
  associations. This prevents accident sending unencrypted packets to air.

  WARNING! This version requires special support from MAC (see Feature#610).
- Feature#610 implemented. From now MSDU fragments number and MIC failures
  notifications are passed from MAC to driver in UMI_DATA message. MSDU
  fragments number is needed to perform Replay Detection correctly for
  fragmented MSDUs. MIC failures notification flag is passed to driver because
  MIC failures has to be alarmed after Replay Detection (which is performed by
  driver).

  new reconnection was interpreted as secure one before 4-Way handshake.

  and as result incorrect GTK was set to MAC.

  /proc/.../MAC)

- Long initial ping time issue was fixed. Broadcast packets were
  reordered that is not correct.
- Reordering change that fixed the "STA disconnects from AP during
  receiving traffic (overnight test failure)" issue. Before this change
  if reordering is slower then the rate of received packets, then
  new packets are just pushed up to OS's stack - this is not correct
  approach. In such situation we have to purge reordering queue.

  to support MAC Cloning was added. Note: the changed new MAC address will
  not be propagated to WiFi MAC address that is in /proc/sys/dev/mtlk/MAC .
- Reordering on AP in bridge mode was not working.

Version - 0.3.1, 2006-11-24
