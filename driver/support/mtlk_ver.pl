# This script is intended to manage version definition
# file used by Metalink driver release system.
# Version definition file contains version in form
#       MTLK_VER=X1.X2. ... .(Xm). ... .[Xk]. ... .Xn
# where Xi are some alphanumeric strings.
# One of the Xi should be enclosed in round brackets.
# One of the Xi should be enclosed in square brackets.
# Component in round version is treated as "major version"
# Component in square brackets is treated as minor version
#
# Script reads input file from STDIN;
#
# There are two modes of the script operation:
#
# 1. Version increase (-i/-I command line parameters):
#  All lines in file except the first line that starts
#  with "MTLK_VER=" keyword are printed to STDOUT as is.
#
#  The first line that starts with "MTLK_VER=" will be
#  procesed in the following way:
#    - If -I command line parameter is given:
#      Major verison will be increased by 1,
#      Minor version will be zeroed;
#    - If -i command line parameter is given:
#      Minor version will be increased by one;
#  The new line contents will be printed to STDOUT
#
# 2. Version extraction (-g command line parameter):
#  All lines in file except the first line that starts
#  with "MTLK_VER=" keyword are ignored.
#  The first line that starts with "MTLK_VER=" will be
#  procesed in the following way:
#    Leading "MTLK_VER=" will be suppressed;
#    All left and right round and square bracket symbols will be suppressed;
#    Resulted string will be printed to STDOUT.
# 3. Branch version extraction (-G command line parameter):
#  All lines in file except the first line that starts
#  with "MTLK_VER=" keyword are ignored.
#  The first line that starts with "MTLK_VER=" will be
#  procesed in the following way:
#    Leading "MTLK_VER=" will be suppressed;
#    Text enclosed by curly braces will be printed to STDOUT
#    Everything else will be suppressed
