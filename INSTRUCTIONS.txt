FOREWORD
============================================================
The information contained in this file have been deducted from
the sources; no contact at all with original authors.

The code and information are released “as is”, with no guarantees.

Also the code is released with Dual BSD/GPL license although 
this original statement is missing in the original tarball.

However, the dual license has been found in previous tarballs thus
it sounds logical that the license must be kept throughout all
evolutions of the sources.

SCOPE
============================================================
This document are instructions in order to setup and run
the Lantiq Wave300 development kit that includes drivers and misc
tools.


INTRODUCTION
============================================================
Base sources are those of wave300-3.2.1.1.48.tar.gz

Code has been up-ported to Linux 4.4 whenever needed, mostly 
with the syntax.

The code was successfully compiled with Ubuntu 16.04.


SETUP
============================================================
[0] Prerequisites
	* Have a Linux environment
	* Have a crosscompiler SDK (e.g. LEDE or Openwrt)
	* Have header files for libnl-tiny
	* Have wireless tools (iwpriv, etc) in target machine
	* Prepare libnl-tiny package with LEDE or Openwrt SDK:
		./scripts/feeds update -a
		./scripts/feeds install libnl-tiny
		make package/libnl-tiny/{clean,compile,install} V=99

	NOTE1: The step above will install the library related to
	libnl-tiny. This library is only needed if MTTOOLS are to be
	built, which is an independent option from the drivers. You can
	skip it if you only want the drivers


	NOTE2: In order to run the wifi driver in your target machine
	you need also to have the firmware files:
		sta_upper.bin
		ap_upper.bin
		contr_lm.bin
		Progmodel_*.bin
	Check README_FW in /lantiq_fw for help.

[1] Set crosscompiler variables
	Edit file driver/support/ugw.env.common and tune to your
	system and needs.

	Almost certain that these paths must be redefined:
	STAGING_DIR
	DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_PATH
	DEFAULT_KERNEL_DIR
	Set local directory for ../libnl-tiny/include
	Set local directory for static libraries

[2] Run menu
	At driver/, enter into the menu:

		>make menuconfig

	You should see the classical blue screen menu.

	Choose your platform.

	Tip: ugw 5.1 has been extensibly tested. You can try that one
	first if you want to know if your system/variables are well
	defined.

	Also ugw5.1-vrx288 will be used as example for the rest of the document.


[3] Check results
	For your information, the studio has automatically created
	a new folder based on your choice under /driver/builds.

	In this folder, some source files are automatically generated.

	Some other are copied or soft linked from the code sources under
	driver/wireless/… or spreaded over.

[4] Make
	Under /driver, run the machine:
		>make

	After a couple of minutes, the file “mtlkroot.ko” should appear in your build directory:
	/driver/builds/ugw5.1-vrx288

	[BUG & WORKAROUND!] If MTTOOLS are to be built, then an error message will pop up:
		"cannot find -lnl"
	By default the sources will search for libnl.so library in your path. Usually
	we will be using the efficient libnl-tiny.a package and hence the error.
	WORKAROUND = rename libnl-tiny.so to libnl.so
	CORRECTIVE = add a menuconfig option to use either tiny-libnl or libnl

[5] Make the proper driver
	So far, only half of the job is done.

	In order to run this driver, 2 modules are needed: mtlkroot.ko & mtlk.ko

	Probably the script that generates the build directory is trunkated.

	Therefore, go to folder 
	/driver/builds/ugw5.1-vrx288/wireless/driver/linux

	and run:
		>make

	After few minutes, but more time that step 4, a new file named “mtlk.ko”
	should appear.

[6] Test your machine
	Bring those files to your platform (router, embedded system…) and
	insert the modules (insmod) in the following order:
		[1] insmod mtlkroot.ko
		[2] insmod mtlk.ko ap=1

	A new wifi interface should appear, usually named wlan0.
	Now setup that interface via wireless tools. Change parameters as per your need.
	Below lines are just an example:
		[3] iwpriv wlan0 sCountry GB
		[4] iwconfig wlan0 essid test
		[5] iwconfig wlan0 channel 52

	Finally bring up the interface:
		[6] ifconfig wlan0 up

	NOTE 1: Wireless wave300 needs of firmware files to be available in your platform.
	These files must be copied into your target /lib/firmware folder

	NOTE 2: It is critical to bootup as ap, therefore to add ap=1 during insmod.
	Otherwise it will simply not work.

[7] Further tweaks (advanced)
	The modules generated accept some parameters, most of them are unexplored.

	We will describe here what we know so far:

	[1] DEBUG MESSAGES
		We can set debugging level of the modules by compiling & inserting later
		as follows:
			[1] At menuconfig level, set debug level, being 9 the highest. Beware
			because the size of the drivers will grow.
			[2] Insert the root driver with desired debug level e.g. 3
				insmod mtlkroot.ko cdebug=3
			[3] Insert next driver in a standard way:
				insmod mtlk.ko ap=1
