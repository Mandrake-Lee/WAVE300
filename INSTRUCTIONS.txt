 Lantiq Wave300 - Wireless Driver & Tools – Development Kit

FOREWORD
============================================================
The information contained in this file have been deducted from
the sources; no contact at all with original authors.

The code and information are released “as is”, with no guarantees.

Also the code is released with Dual BSD/GPL license although 
this original statement is missing in the original tarball.

However, the dual license has been found in previous tarballs thus
it sounds logical that the license must be kept throughout all
evolutions of the sources.

SCOPE
============================================================
This document are instructions in order to setup and run
the Lantiq Wave300 development kit that includes drivers and misc
tools.


INTRODUCTION
============================================================
Base sources are those of wave300-3.2.1.1.48.tar.gz

Code has been up-ported to Linux 4.4 whenever needed, mostly 
with the syntax.

The code was successfully compiled with Ubuntu 16.04.


SETUP
============================================================
[0] Prerequisites
	Have a Linux environment
	Have a crosscompiler SDK (e.g. LEDE or Openwrt)
	Have header files for libnl-tiny

	Prepare libnl-tiny package with LEDE or Openwrt SDK:
		./scripts/feeds update -a
		./scripts/feeds install libnl-tiny
		make package/libnl-tiny/{clean,compile,install} V=99

	NOTE: In order to run the wifi driver in your target machine
	you need also to have the firmware files:
		sta_upper.bin
		ap_upper.bin
		contr_lm.bin

[1] Set crosscompiler variables
	Edit file driver/support/ugw.env.common and tune to your
	system and needs.

	Almost certain that these paths must be redefined:
	STAGING_DIR
	DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_PATH
	DEFAULT_KERNEL_DIR
	Set local directory for ../libnl-tiny/include

[2] Run menu
	At driver/, enter into the menu:

		>make menuconfig

	You should see the classical blue screen menu.

	Choose your platform.

	Tip: ugw 5.1 has been extensibly tested. You can try that one
	first if you want to know if your system/variables are well
	defined.

	Also ugw5.1-vrx288 will be used as example for the rest of the document.


[3] Check results
	For your information, the studio has automatically created
	a new folder based on your choice under /driver/builds.

	In this folder, some source files are automatically generated.

	Some other are copied or soft linked from the code sources under
	driver/wireless/… or spreaded over.

[4] Make
	Under /driver, run the machine:
		>make

	After a couple of minutes, the file “mtlkroot.ko” should appear in your build directory:
	/driver/builds/ugw5.1-vrx288

[5] Make the proper driver
	So far, only half of the job is done.

	In order to run this driver, 2 modules are needed: mtlkroot.ko & mtlk.ko

	Probably the script that generates the build directory is trunkated.

	Therefore, go to folder 
	/driver/builds/ugw5.1-vrx288/wireless/driver/linux

	and run:
		>make

	After few minutes, but more time that step 4, a new file named “mtlk.ko”
	should appear.

[6] Test your machine
	Bring those files to your platform (router, embedded system…) and
	insert the modules (insmod) in the following order:
		[1] mtlkroot.ko
		[2] mtlk.ko
	NOTE: Wireless wave300 needs of firmware files to be available in your platform.
	These files must be copies into your target /lib/firmware folder
