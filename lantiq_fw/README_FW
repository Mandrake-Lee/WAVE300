FIRMWARE
============================================================
In practice, it seems there must be a match between the driver
version release and the firmware (*.bin) files that are 
uploaded to the wave3000 chip during bootup.

The only successful binaries found up to date are embedded into image:
	TD-W8980_V1_131012.zip

More conveniently, just the interesting binaries have been ripped off:
	https://ufile.io/yha8i

In the latter link one can find the folling files:
	ap_upper.bin
	contr_lm.bin
	ProgModel_A_CB_38_RevA.bin
	ProgModel_A_CB.bin
	ProgModel_A_nCB_38_RevA.bin
	ProgModel_A_nCB.bin
	sta_upper.bin

During driver bootup, the internal release of these binaries is:
	ap_upper.bin: @@@ VERSION INFO @@@ version number: FW_3.2.1_r5437 MIPS:  Upper CPU(TMC AGG AP) interface: PCI  phy type: real phy on Mar 28 2012 at 11:00:01@@@ END @@@

	contr_lm.bin: @@@ VERSION INFO @@@ version number: FW_3.2.1_r5437 MIPS:  Lower MAC  interface: --  phy type: real phy on Mar 28 2012 at 10:59:46@@@ END @@@
